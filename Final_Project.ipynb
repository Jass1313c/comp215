        "**What is Hydraulic Fracturing(Fracking)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique used to extract oil and natural gas from deep underground rock formations. A well is drilled vertically and then horizontally into shale. A high-pressure mixture of water, sand, and chemicals is injected to create fractures in the rock, enhancing its permeability. The sand holds the fractures open, allowing hydrocarbons to flow into the well.Although fracking has revolutionized energy production, it raises environmental concerns including large water usage, chemical contamination, and potential induced seismicity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hydraulic fracturing began on a small scale in the 1940s, but its large-scale application started in the 1990s. The breakthrough came with the development of techniques in the Barnett Shale of Texas, which demonstrated that shale gas could be produced economically. This success, combined with advances in horizontal drilling and improved fracking technologies, led to rapid expansion throughout the early 2000s, sparking the shale gas revolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**OVERVIEW**\n",
        "\n",
        " In this project, we investigate the extent to which fracking may be causing earthquakes. We leverage comprehensive datasets from Texas, including detailed fracking operation records and seismic data, to analyze the spatial and temporal relationships between fracking activities and earthquake events. Our methodology involves filtering earthquakes based on proximity to fracking sites, depth, and timing relative to operations. Additionally, we compute an Induced Seismicity Index (ISI) by integrating key parameters such as injected water volume, horizontal distance, and depth difference. Through advanced visualization and statistical analyses, our study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of induced seismicity and inform improved regulatory practices and industry standards for safer hydraulic fracturing.\n"

        "We chose a maximum earthquake depth of 10 kilometers because induced seismic events, especially those related to fracking operations, generally occur at shallow depths. Limiting our analysis to this shallow region ensures that the earthquakes considered are more likely directly related to hydraulic fracturing activities rather than natural tectonic processes, which typically occur at greater depths.\n",

        "The very first question that comes to mind is whether earthquakes meeting these parameters (shallow events with depths under 10 km and magnitude ≥ 1) were present in Texas before the onset of mass fracking. To address this, we compare earthquake data from a pre-fracking period (2007–2010) with data from a period during intensive fracking (2024–2025). This comparison helps us determine if there has been a significant change in seismic activity that could be linked to hydraulic fracturing operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Texas is not located on a tectonic plate boundary; rather, it sits on the stable interior of the North American Plate. This stability is one reason why significant earthquakes in Texas are relatively rare and why any notable seismic activity is often scrutinized for potential human-induced causes, such as hydraulic fracturing."

        "we concentrate on assessing the direct impact of hydraulic fracking on induced seismicity. Our analysis targets earthquake events that occur near fracking sites, particularly those with shallow depths (<10 km) and within close proximity to the operations. Althought, the second cluster appears farther from the fracking sites and may be associated with wastewater injection practices. Wastewater injection, used for disposing of produced water, can trigger seismicity even at greater distances. Credible sources, including the USGS, indicate that such induced seismicity can occur away from the direct fracking zone.\n",

You can choose any fracking location by changing the index (e.g., using fracking_data_list[49] as shown). The visualization displays the fracking site with two nodes: one representing the site at the surface (depth = 0) and another at its actual operational depth. All associated earthquake events are added as nodes using their true depth values, and the nodes include formatted coordinate information (to two decimals) on hover. The 3D plot, with inverted z-axis (surface at the top), enables exploration of the spatial relationship between the fracking site and nearby earthquakes.\n"

        "This cell filters earthquake events relative to each fracking site by applying both spatial and temporal criteria. For each fracking site, the horizontal distance from its WGS84 coordinates to each earthquake is calculated using geodesic distance, and only events within a 10 km radius are retained. Additionally, a time window is defined—from one day before to nine days after the fracking site’s JobStartDate—to select events that occur near in time to the fracking activity. The vertical difference between the earthquake depth and the site’s true vertical depth is computed, and all relevant details are stored in a dictionary keyed by site index. Notably, the horizontal radius and time window parameters can be adjusted for experimental purposes to evaluate their impact on the analysis.\n"

        "Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates a robust correlation between hydraulic fracturing and induced seismicity. The Induced Seismicity Index (ISI)—derived from total base water volume, horizontal distance, and vertical depth difference—indicates that fracking sites with higher water injection volumes are strongly associated with nearby seismic events. These findings are supported by credible research. For example, USGS studies on induced earthquakes illustrate how fluid injection alters subsurface stress conditions, triggering seismicity (https://www.usgs.gov/publications/induced-seismicity-strategic-vision). Similarly, Ellsworth (2013) explains the mechanism of injection-induced earthquakes (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1225942)\n",
        ". As injection volumes and operational durations increase, the potential for larger-magnitude earthquakes grows, emphasizing the need for enhanced monitoring and stricter regulatory oversight."
